<h1 align="center"> Hi there 👋 </h1>
I'm an IT Student with passion of Software Development 😇. I'm a confident communicator, I integrate easily into teams, though I am equally happy to work alone. 🤗 I am a quick, logical thinker with an analytical mind and enjoy the stimulation of a challenge 💪. I like variety and am adaptable in different situations, to which I respond with enthusiasm and a sense of humor. I am always keen to learn something new 👌.
