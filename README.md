Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm an IT Student with passion of Software Development . I'm a confident communicator, I integrate easily into teams, though I am equally happy to work alone. I am a quick, logical thinker with an analytical mind and enjoy the stimulation of a challenge. I like variety and am adaptable in different situations, to which I respond with enthusiasm and a sense of humor. I am computer-literate and am always keen to learn something new.
